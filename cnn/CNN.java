/**
 * This is the base layer of the convolutional neural network. 
 * Essentially, this object will handle the layers, and the order in which they are processed.
 * 
 * Calculations for the layers will be handled within the layer, and passed back to the neural network in the end 
 * in order to determine the overall learning rate.
 * 
 * Using the data returned, the network can then further experiment with the number of neurons/layers, randomising the amount used,
 * thus being able to determine the optimal number of layers/neurons per layer to achieve a better learning rate.
 * 
 * Effectively learning how to learn.
